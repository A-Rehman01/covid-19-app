                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease .
                The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking.
                The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.
                people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.
